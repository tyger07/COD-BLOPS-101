<b>Call of Duty: Black Ops Gamepack</b><br/><br/>
First of all, thanks to RedbeardCrunch, J2Kbr, Layman, Scachi, Antithesis, ETB, and Dione. This is a mashup of published code from those sources.

Optimized script with Auto Sprint, Slide Cancel, Turbo Melee, Bunny Hop, Rapid Fire, Polar Aim Assist Boost, Trigger Jitter, Auto Hold Breath, Auto Reload Cancel, Drop Shot, and Recoil control for the <a href="https://www.consoletuner.com/products/titan-two/">Titan Two</a>.

<b>Recommended Game Settings:</b><br/>
Button Layout: Tactical, Tactical Flipped, Default, or Default Flipped (select below)<br/>
Crouch: Toggle<br/>
Sprint Assist: Off<br/>
Movement: Hybrid<br/>
Aim Assist: Standard/Black Ops<br/>
Aim Response Curve: Dynamic/Standard<br/>

<b>LED Indicator:</b><br/>
Green, Blue, Yellow, Red: Aim assist boost strength. Default aim assist boost values are at upper end of blue range which is where aim shoupd feel pretty sticky.
Pink blinking: ADS toggled off (recoil control and aim assist boost for hip fire too).

<b>Controls:</b><br/>
All mods toggled via Gamepack Configurator and some via controller where noted below.

Toggle aim assist boost: Press aim and fire button + lethal button.<br/>
Adjust aim assist strength: When aim assist toggled enabled: Press aim and fire button + dpad up or down.<br/>
Adjust recoil vertical: When aim assist toggled disabled:</u> Press aim and fire button + dpad up or down.<br/>
Adjust recoil horizontal: Press aim and fire button + dpad left or right.<br/>
Toggle hip fire recoil control and hip fire aim assist: Press aim and fire button + tactical button.<br/>
Drop Shot: Circle/B press when left stick is backwards.<br/>
Slide Cancel: RS/R3 during sprint (left stick forward).<br/>
Auto Reload Cancel: Triangle/Y press when left stick is backwards.<br/>
Bunny Hop: Cross/A press when left stick is forward.<br/>

Note: Slide Cancel and Bunny Hop use left stick forward; Auto Reload Cancel and Drop Shot use left stick backward.<br/>

<b>Button Layout:</b><br/>
Select your controller button layout: Tactical, Default, Tactical Flipped, or Default Flipped<br/>

<b>Adjust Polar Aim Assist boost strength:</b><br/>
2.0 while aiming and firing is not very annoying, but not very sticky.<br/>
Stickiness starts around 4.5.<br/>
6.0 is pretty sticky without being crazy.<br/>
Adjust to your preference.<br/>

<b>Toggle ADS:</b><br/>
Enabled: Aim Assist boost and Anti-Recoil control only while holding aim down sight button. Use for long-distanced game modes where accuracy is needed and for game modes with lots of vehicles or parachuting.<br/>
Disabled: Aim Assist boost and Anti-Recoil control affect hip fire too. Use for short-distanced game modes where quick kills are required, vehicle and parachuting shake will not distract you, and where accuracy of jumping through windows is not a factor.<br/>

Note: Disabled will negatively affect camera while driving, and will be shakey while running.<br/>

<b>Stick Noise (Dead Zone):</b><br/>
If you want to tweak this, set it to the max value of your sticks resting position values. Use the "Device Monitor" to examine them. Set to minimum if you want sticky aim even when resting. Increase value to eliminate screen shake when resting (but not sticky).<br/>

<b>Universal Anti-Recoil</b><br/>
Anti recoil vertical: steps the gun in opposing vertical direction in a time period.<br/>
Anti recoil horizontal: steps the gun in opposing horizontal direction in a time period.<br/>

Note: When Toggle ADS is enabled, anti-recoil control will only affect firing while aim down sight button is held. Disabling Toggle ADS will allow anti-recoil to affect hip fire as well, but will negatively interact with the view while driving.
